# CelebShot - Development-as-Golf Celebrity Shot Hiring App Marketplace

**Branch**: `contemplations/celebshot`  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: Contemplation Phase

---

## 🎯 Vision

CelebShot is a mini app marketplace deployed on Farcaster that enables developers to frame their development problems using a golf ontology, then request "celebrity shots" from expert software engineers and prompters who can provide specialized guidance to advance their projects.

### Core Concept

- **Development-as-Golf Metaphor**: Projects are golf courses, problems are holes, solutions are shots
- **Celebrity Shot Model**: Expert prompters/engineers provide specialized guidance
- **Visual Problem Framing**: SVG representations using emoji building blocks to visualize the problem space and course
- **Expert Matching**: System matches problems with best-fit experts based on technical and domain expertise
- **CELO Integration**: Transactions via CELO Ethereum L2 for payments and marketplace mechanics
