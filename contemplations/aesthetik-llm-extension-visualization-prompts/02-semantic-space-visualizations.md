## 1. Hyperdimensional Manifold Visualization

### Prompt: Dimensional Collapse Visualization

```
A geometric abstract visualization showing the dimensional collapse from high-dimensional space (ℝ⁴⁰⁹⁶) to 2D visualization. Warped elliptical layers representing dimensional cross-sections, with the widest ellipses at the far end (high dimensions) gradually narrowing to a near-perfect circle at the front (2D projection). A glowing gradient trajectory path shows iterative shot progression through the space, colored from purple (#667eea) through pink (#f093fb) and cyan (#4facfe) to green (#56ab2f). Warped grid lines suggest non-linear manifold structure. A geometric vector-based figure represents the golfer/developer in mid-swing. Mathematical annotations show dimension counts at each layer: ℝ⁴⁰⁹⁶ → ℝ¹⁰⁰⁰ → ℝ¹⁰⁰ → ℝ¹⁰ → ℝ². Deep space background (#0a0e27) with subtle glowing effects. Abstract, mathematical, elegant, precise. Aspect ratio 16:9, high detail, vector art style.

## 2. Semantic Space Navigation

### Prompt: Trajectory Path Through Semantic Space

```
A smooth, flowing trajectory path showing the journey through semantic space. The path starts in purple/blue tones (Deep Ocean Blue #1A5F7A, uncertainty, rough terrain) and gradually transitions through green tones (Forest Green #2D5016, refinement, fairway) to yellow/orange (Golden Yellow #B8860B, precision, approach) and finally red (Burnt Orange #CC5500, convergence, green). The path has varying thickness: thin at start (low confidence, thin line) thickening toward the end (high confidence, thick line). Gradient glow effect along the path. Small dots along the path represent discrete shots/states. Arrows show direction of travel. Background: deep space (#0a0e27) with subtle stars. Abstract, flowing, elegant. Aspect ratio 16:9, high detail.

## 3. Semantic Clamp Visualization

### Prompt: Semantic Space Clamp Visualization

```
An interactive 2D/3D projection of high-dimensional semantic space showing a semantic clamp visualization. The visualization shows a central point (current position) with a circular "clamp" region showing the constraint radius. Club length determines clamp radius: Putter (tight ±0.1, small circle in Deep Ocean Blue #1A5F7A), Wedge (moderate-tight ±0.3, medium circle in Forest Green #2D5016), Iron (moderate ±0.5, larger circle in Golden Yellow #B8860B), Driver (loose ±0.8, largest circle in Burnt Orange #CC5500). The clamp region is shown as a translucent overlay with glowing edges. Background: deep space (#0a0e27) with subtle grid lines suggesting high-dimensional structure. Mathematical annotations show clamp radius and intensity. Abstract, mathematical, precise. Aspect ratio 1:1, high detail, 3D projection style.

## 4. LLM Interaction Flow

### Prompt: LLM Interaction Flow Diagram

```
A flow diagram showing LLM interaction process. Starting point: "User Prompt" (left side) in Deep Ocean Blue (#1A5F7A). Flow arrows show progression: "Prompt Input" → "Semantic Embedding" → "High-Dimensional Space" (ℝⁿ) → "Semantic Processing" → "Response Generation" → "Response Output" (right side). Each stage shows color progression from Deep Ocean Blue (#1A5F7A) through Forest Green (#2D5016) to Golden Yellow (#B8860B). The "High-Dimensional Space" stage shows a 3D projection of semantic space with warped ellipses. Side branches show: "Confidence Calculation" (circular gauge), "Terrain Classification" (Rough/Fairway/Approach/Green), "Shot Type Selection" (Driver/Iron/Wedge/Putter). Background: subtle gradient from deep space (#0a0e27) to pale blue (#E8F4F8). Abstract, flowing, informative. Aspect ratio 16:9, high detail, diagram style.

## 5. Dimensional Cross-Sections

### Prompt: Dimensional Cross-Sections Visualization

```
A series of ellipses in perspective showing dimensional cross-sections. Wider ellipses at the far end (representing high dimensions, ℝ⁴⁰⁹⁶) gradually narrowing to nearly circular at the near end (representing 2D collapse, ℝ²). Warping and distortion between ellipses show non-linear manifold structure. Subtle mathematical annotations: dimension counts (ℝ¹⁰⁰⁰ → ℝ¹⁰⁰ → ℝ¹⁰ → ℝ²) displayed at each layer. Grid overlay suggests mathematical precision. Color: gradient from purple (#667eea, high-D) through pink/cyan (#f093fb, #4facfe, mid-D) to green (#56ab2f, low-D). Glowing edges, depth.

## 6. Vector Arrows (Semantic Directions)

### Prompt: Semantic Direction Vectors

```
Multiple vector arrows radiating from a central point, showing available semantic directions in high-dimensional space. Arrows of varying lengths represent magnitude of change. Directions show different semantic shifts. Color coding: Deep Ocean Blue (#1A5F7A) arrows for exploratory directions (rough), Forest Green (#2D5016) for refinement (fairway), Golden Yellow (#B8860B) for precision (approach), Burnt Orange (#CC5500) for convergence (green).

### Prompt: Manifold Topology Visualization

```
A warped grid/net structure showing manifold topology. Non-Euclidean distortion suggests complex space structure. Grid lines vary in density: dense in high-D regions (purple #667eea), sparse in low-D regions (green #56ab2f). Warping and curvature show local manifold structure. Colors: Deep Ocean Blue (#1A5F7A) tones for space, Forest Green (#2D5016) tones for manifold, Golden Yellow (#B8860B) tones for convergence. Subtle depth, glowing edges.
