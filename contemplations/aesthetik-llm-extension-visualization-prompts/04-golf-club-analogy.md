## 1. Golf Club Rack Interface

### Prompt: Horizontal Golf Club Rack

```
A horizontal golf club rack interface for club selection. Four clubs arranged horizontally: Putter (shortest, low intensity, Deep Ocean Blue #1A5F7A), Wedge (short, medium-low intensity, Forest Green #2D5016), Iron (medium, medium intensity, Golden Yellow #B8860B), Driver (longest, high intensity, Burnt Orange #CC5500). Each club shows length visually with proportional sizing. Hover/click to select shows visual feedback: selected club highlighted with glow effect, shows prompt intensity level and semantic clamp magnitude. Below: explanation text for each club. Putter: "Low intensity, tight clamp (±0.1), final precision refinements". Wedge: "Medium-low intensity, moderate-tight clamp (±0.3), approach zone refinement". Iron: "Medium intensity, moderate clamp (±0.5), fairway iteration". Driver: "High intensity, loose clamp (±0.8), initial exploration from rough". Background: subtle gradient from warm beige (#F5F5DC) to pale green (#E8F5E1). Clean, intuitive, skeuomorphic. Aspect ratio 16:3, high detail, UI design style.
