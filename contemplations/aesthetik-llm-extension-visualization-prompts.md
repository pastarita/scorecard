# Aesthetik LLM Extension Visualization Prompts

This contemplation peruses the in-flight pull request authored from `main` (diffing `IMPLEMENTATION-PRIORITY-PLAN.md` and `app/page.tsx`) alongside the Prompt Classifier planning corpus to synthesize prompt scaffolds for the forthcoming IDE extension visualization. The goal is to transpose the structural elements from the pull request into LVLM-ready prompt packets that faithfully echo the three-domain ontological map rendered in `public/diagrams/ontological-mapping-diagram.svg` and summarized in `contemplations/semantic-motifs/THREE-DOMAIN-ONTOLOGY-RECAP.md`.

## Source Context Survey

- `IMPLEMENTATION-PRIORITY-PLAN.md` (diff) — introduces **Acceptance Specificity** via the adjustable-hole precision analogy and relativistic-intention steering vectors.
- `app/page.tsx` (diff) — remodels the homepage around **Entry Points**, **Semantic Modes**, and **Motif Signals**, each carrying concise onboarding prompts.
- `vscode-ext-prd/PROMPT-CLASSIFIER-README.md` — codifies archetype taxonomy, shot types, quality metrics, and usage narratives.
- `vscode-ext-prd/TECHNICAL-SPEC-PROMPT-CLASSIFIER.md` — details feature extraction, classification flow, and metric calculations that the extension visualizations must expose.
- `vscode-ext-prd/PROMPT-CLASSIFIER-DIAGRAMS.md` — enumerates system diagrams (Mermaid) for classification flow, decision trees, and pipeline stages.
- `contemplations/semantic-motifs/THREE-DOMAIN-ONTOLOGY-RECAP.md` — documents baseline golf ⇄ math ⇄ LLM domain primitives, relationship lattice, and SVG variant directives.

## Pull Request Zycus

**Strategic Arc:** The PR pivots the public landing page into a semantic manifold that mirrors IDE extension aspirations while framing Acceptance Specificity as the guiding principle for toolchain configuration.

1. **Acceptance Specificity Doctrine**  
   - Hole-size analogy (golf domain) grounds precision prompts.  
   - Relativistic intention unlocks mathematical steering vectors (gradient audits) that orchestrate LLM procedures.
2. **Landing Page Manifold**  
   - Entry cards act as prompt capsules mapping to application strata (scorecard dashboard, prototypes, IDE extension, diagrams).  
   - Semantic mode tiles reuse archetype language from the Visual Classifier.  
   - Motif signals expose instrumentation hooks (fatness gauge, analogy ledger, knowledge blades, flattening countermeasures) destined for IDE overlays.
3. **Cross-Domain Alignment**  
   - The modifications embed the ontology-methodology-application braids called out in the ontological recap, providing textual seeds for LVLM diagram generation.

## Prompt Set Templates (LVLM Ready)

### 1. Precision Calibration Prompt
```
Render a triptych showing golf hole diameter scaling (large → standard → micro) with overlay text: "Acceptance Specificity". Map each panel to epsilon-ball radius shrinkage and IDE prompt strictness levels. Use scorecard olive (#556b2f) accents, serif headings, mono captions.
```

### 2. Steering Vector Ritual Prompt
```
Illustrate documentation, hook, and test glyphs orbiting a shot trajectory vector field. Annotate arrows with "Relativistic Intention" and gradient preservation bands. Connect to IDE panels that show prompt interception points. Maintain ontological tri-column layout (Golf | Mathematics | LLM).
```

### 3. Entry Manifold Prompt
```
Design a homepage hero board with five entry cards labeled Scorecard Dashboard, Prototype Gallery, IDE Extension, Diagram Presenter, Motif Contemplations. Each card must carry iconography from app/page.tsx, slot into the Golf→Math→LLM braid, and include an invitation line under 18 words.
```

### 4. Archetype Lattice Prompt
```
Plot Convergent, Precision, Explorer, Creative nodes on a diamond grid. For each, attach a wedge/iron/driver/putter badge and quality metric bars sourced from the Prompt Classifier. Show how IDE overlays switch modes via analogy ledger toggles.
```

### 5. Motif Signal Overlay Prompt
```
Create IDE gutter visuals featuring Shot Fatness Gauge, Analogy Ledger toggle, Knowledge Blade citation pin, Flattening Countermeasure banner. Each overlay should reference its golf-terrain counterpart and show corresponding mathematical gradient annotations.
```

## Prompt Iteration Suite

### Precision Calibration Variants
- **Variant A — Par Ladder**: Emphasize a vertical stack of tee boxes with hole diameters shrinking top-to-bottom; annotate each rung with par expectations and epsilon tolerances. Overlay a prompt strictness slider on the side rail.
- **Variant B — Club Alignment Grid**: Show driver, iron, wedge, putter laid across a grid where hole diameters contract horizontally; pair each club with textual acceptance criteria and numerical sigma bounds for IDE validation.
- **Variant C — Temporal Zoom**: Depict a time-lapse strip where the cup contracts over successive shots; link each frame to stepwise prompt refinement badges (Draft → Tighten → Execute).

### Steering Vector Ritual Variants
- **Variant A — Tri-Orbit Halo**: Position documentation, hook, and test glyphs on concentric orbits around a central trajectory; use gradient bands to show how interventions bend the path before impact.
- **Variant B — Vector Field Blueprint**: Render a top-down map with arrows bending around obstacles; place ritual icons at intersection nodes labeled “Intercept,” “Redirect,” “Validate,” synchronizing with IDE hook panels.
- **Variant C — Ritual Timeline**: Lay out a left-to-right storyboard where each frame pairs a club swing with a corresponding intervention (doc briefing, hook trigger, test run) and displays the resulting gradient shift.

### Entry Manifold Variants
- **Variant A — Radial Entry Dial**: Arrange the five entry cards around a circular dial with a central ontology glyph; connect each card to its domain strand via colored spokes.
- **Variant B — Staggered Fairway**: Place cards along a staggered fairway path moving from tee (Scorecard Dashboard) to green (Motif Contemplations); include elevation markers for methodological depth.
- **Variant C — Layered Stack**: Stack translucent panels representing Golf, Mathematics, LLM; embed each entry card on the layer where it primarily operates, with faint connectors indicating secondary influence.

### Archetype Lattice Variants
- **Variant A — Diamond Matrix**: Maintain diamond arrangement but add elevation rings to indicate confidence tiers; display prompt classifier metrics as radial bars extending from each archetype node.
- **Variant B — Polar Plot**: Map archetypes to compass points with radius encoding shot type confidence; draw paths illustrating transitions captured by the analogy ledger.
- **Variant C — Multi-Deck Ledger**: Create stacked canvases (golf layer, math layer, LLM layer) where archetype nodes align vertically; use translucent bridges to show mode synchronization across layers.

### Motif Signal Overlay Variants
- **Variant A — Gutter Stack**: Visualize IDE gutter widgets as a vertical ribbon with discrete capsules for each motif; include hover callouts showing the golf terrain counterpart.
- **Variant B — Split Pane Diagnostics**: Show a two-pane interface where code resides left and motif diagnostics right; each diagnostic panel mirrors a mathematical annotation chart.
- **Variant C — Timeline Markers**: Present motif signals as chronological markers along a development timeline; each marker references both the shot phase and the gradient preservation log entry.

## Integration Plan for `ontological-mapping-diagram.svg`

- **Layer Mapping**: Extend the existing three-domain SVG by injecting prompt capsules as callouts bound to each domain node.
- **Color Tokens**: Reuse Tailwind tokens from `app/page.tsx` to ensure visual parity with the landing page manifold.
- **Metadata Hooks**: Plan manifest entries with `tags` such as `["prompt-extension","acceptance-specificity","semantic-mode"]` for ingestion into `lib/svg-manifest.json`.

## Next Moves

1. Convert the five LVLM prompt templates into SVG brief sheets and append them to the diagram manifest stub list.  
2. Draft IDE extension overlay mockups that reuse the Motif Signal prompt vocabulary.  
3. Author a follow-up contemplation connecting Acceptance Specificity rituals to the Prompt Classifier technical pipeline for implementation planning.
