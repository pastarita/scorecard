# Hyperdimensional Vector Space Golf: A Talk for Everyone

**Why Building Software is Like Playing Golf—And How That Changes Everything**

---

Every AI interaction is a shot toward your goal. While there any many ideas and methods for how to create & code better with the tools; there has yet to be a cogent method presented for how to aim, which strategy to use, or when to stop. 

It's likely you're burning time, money, and your own patience shooting blind into LLM Semantic Embedding Space.

Hyperdimensional Vector Space Golf (Score- and Stat-Keeping) makes LLM-leveraged work more like a game of skill and strategy. In this talk,  we'll use golf-inspired meditative practices such as success-envisioning, shot-making, and retrospective-analysis to improve your scoping, prompting, and reflection to get better results in fewer 'strokes'.

The result: beginners prompt better, developers build faster, researchers prove theories, and everyone speaks the same language(i.e. drives, puts, pu). You'll get a common langauge and thereby navigation system approaching AI work in a way that actually delivers. Stop wandering. Start shaping better shots at your goals.
