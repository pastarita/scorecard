Center panel (blue gradient #3d5a7c to #1a3a5a): mathematical notation showing manifold structures, vectors, and ℝⁿ symbols. Right panel (purple gradient #7c3d5a to #4a1a3a): code snippets, prompt boxes, and response bubbles. Glowing connecting arrows flow horizontally between panels showing semantic correspondence. Each panel contains 3-5 key concepts vertically aligned. Background: deep space (#0a0e27). Geometric borders separate domains. Labels at top identify each domain.

Spiral starts wide at bottom (exploration, rough terrain, underspecified prompts) and tightens toward top (convergence, green precision, exact solution). Each helix strand shows domain-specific milestones: golf (terrain transitions), math (manifold constraints), LLM (prompt refinements). Glowing nodes mark equivalent positions across helices. Rainbow gradient flows upward showing progression. Central axis shows unified shot count/iteration number. Background: deep space (#0a0e27) fading to brighter toward top. Dynamic, ascending, unified.

**Process Flow Visualizations:** Use for demonstrating iterative workflows, convergence patterns, and temporal progression through semantic space.

**Architectural Overview:** Use for comprehensive reference materials, poster designs, and showing the complete framework structure.

### Customization Notes

All prompts can be customized by:
- Adjusting aspect ratios for specific output needs
- Emphasizing specific domain relationships
- Adding specific examples or annotations
