## Branch Organization Convention

This project uses a standardized branch naming convention for organizing development work:

### Branch Types

1. **Contemplations** (`contemplations/[name]`)
   - High-level architectural thinking and planning
   - Design documents and conceptual exploration
   - Use for initial feature exploration

2. **Studies** (`studies/[name]`)
   - Deep dives into specific implementations
   - Variable studies and research
   - Performance analysis and technical deep dives

3. **Prototypes** (`prototypes/[name]`)
   - Working implementations and experimental features
   - Functional prototypes and proof of concepts
   - User-facing features

### When Creating New Work

- **Planning/Design**: Create `contemplations/[feature-name]` branch
- **Research/Analysis**: Create `studies/[study-name]` branch
- **Implementation**: Create `prototypes/[prototype-name]` branch

### Code Organization

- Prototypes live in `/app/prototypes` and `/components/prototypes`
- Follow the branch convention when organizing new features
- Reference branch names in commit messages: `[contemplation]`, `[study]`, `[prototype]`

### Documentation

- See `BRANCH-CONVENTION.md` for full details
- Update documentation when convention evolves
- Keep branch names consistent across the project

## Project-Specific Rules

### Component Structure
- Use semantic domain naming: `components/prototypes/[domain]/[component]`
- Extract reusable components to appropriate directories
- Document component purpose and semantic domain in comments

### Styling
- Use TailwindCSS with scorecard theme colors
- Follow existing scorecard aesthetic (`#556b2f`, `#8b956d`, etc.)
- Maintain responsive design patterns

### TypeScript
- Use strict typing
- Define types in `/types` directory
- Export interfaces for component props

### React/Next.js
- Use "use client" for interactive components
- Prefer server components when possible
- Handle SSR/hydration carefully (see fog visualization for examples)

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working on this project:

1. **Respect Branch Convention**: Understand which branch type you're working on
2. **Follow Semantic Domains**: Use domain-driven component organization
3. **Maintain Aesthetic**: Keep scorecard visual style consistent
4. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Test Responsively**: Consider mobile, tablet, and desktop views
